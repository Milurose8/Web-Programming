<h1>Microsoft</h1>
<p>Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"[5]) was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975,
 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with 
MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its
 share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees.
