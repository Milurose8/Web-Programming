<h1>Google</h1>
<p>Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California.
 Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They
 incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware
 on October 22, 2002. An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain 
 View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.
