One of the most famous Indian monuments is the India Gate in New Delhi. The foundation stone of this<br>
 War Memorial was laid by Duke of Connaught in 1921. The construction of this 42-metre-tall archway<br>
 was finally completed in 1931. Its beautiful arch was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and it imitated the<br>
 architecture of the famous monument Arc de Triomphe which is in Paris. The names of the brave soldiers<br>
 who fought in World War I and Anglo-Afgan War are inscribed on the arch.
