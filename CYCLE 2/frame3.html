The Red Fort in Delhi was built in the mid 17th century by the famous Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It is<br>
 located in Old Delhi and this architectural genius was home to many Mughal emperors for a long time.<br>
 The fort is segregated into various sections that include entertainment halls, baths, canals, balconies,<br>
 mosques, etc and it boasts of Indo-Islamic and Mughal designs. This massive fort is 75-feet high and has<br>
 been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. Every year, the prime minister of our country unfurls our<br>
 national flag from Red Fort on Independence Day.
