 Most people around the world associate India with Taj Mahal and it would not be wrong to say that this
 Indian monument is the pride of our nation. This magnificent mausoleum is situated on the banks of river
 Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It was built by the great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his
 beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. Around 22,000 artisans from across India, Iran, and Central Asia took 20
 years to complete this architectural wonder.
